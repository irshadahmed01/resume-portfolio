            <p><strong>VLOOKUP:</strong> <code>=VLOOKUP("401K", B3:C52, 2, FALSE)</code> to look up the Current Value of specific investments (e.g., 401K: $6,597).</p>
            <p><strong>COUNTIF:</strong> <code>=COUNTIF(D3:D102, "HIGH")</code> in A106 to count high-value investments (51).</p>

        <h2>Day 2, Task 1: Finding and Fixing Data Errors</h2>
        <p>I reviewed my initial 50-row dataset for errors. I fixed typos in 14 Investment Names, such as changing "chrunchyroll" to "Crunchyroll" and "bugati" to "Bugatti." I found no blanks or zeros in Dollars Invested or Current Value. I noted that ChatOpenAI had no growth ($425 invested, $425 value), which might need further investigation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Day 2, Task 2: Using IF and VLOOKUP Functions</h2>
        <p>I added a "Value Category" column using <code>=IF(C3>5000, "High", "Low")</code> to flag investments with a Current Value greater than $5,000. I used <code>=VLOOKUP("401K", B3:C52, 2, FALSE)</code> to find the Current Value of 401K ($6,597) and Mid-Cap Mutual Fund ($3,234). I counted 22 high-value investments using <code>=COUNTIF(D3:D52, "High")</code>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Day 2, Task 3: Conditional Formatting</h2>
        <p>I used conditional formatting to highlight Current Values greater than $5,000 in green and less than or equal to $5,000 in red. This made it easy to see that investments like Sundry ($9,974) are high-value (green), while Google Stock ($1,000) is low-value (red).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Day 2, Task 4: Expanding the Dataset</h2>
        <p>I expanded my dataset to 100 rows by adding 50 more realistic investments, such as "Samsung Stock" ($300 invested, $9,950 value) and "AI Startup Stock" ($430 invested, $650 value). I updated my summaries: Total Invested is now $53,580, Total Current Value is $519,700, and I have 51 high-value investments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Day 2, Task 5: Cleaning the Dataset</h2>
        <p>I sorted my 100-row dataset by Current Value from highest to lowest, with Samsung Stock ($9,950) at the top and OpenAI Stock ($600) at the bottom. I checked for duplicates using "Data" > "Remove Duplicates," removed 3 duplicates (Instagram, Gmail, Google Bond), and added 3 new rows (e.g., Biotech Stock, $250 invested, $4,000 value) to maintain 100 rows.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Day 2, Task 6: Summarizing with New Functions</h2>
        <p>I used <code>=SUMIF(D3:D102, "HIGH", C3:C102)</code> to calculate the total Current Value of high-value investments ($385,850) and <code>=AVERAGEIF(D3:D102, "HIGH", C3:C102)</code> to find their average ($7,565.69). I also used <code>=SUMIF(D3:D102, "LOW", C3:C102)</code> and <code>=AVERAGEIF(D3:D102, "LOW", C3:C102)</code> to calculate the total ($133,850) and average ($2,731.63) for low-value investments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Day 2, Task 7: Analysis of the Dataset</h2>
        <p>My portfolio of 100 investments has a total Current Value of $519,700, nearly a 10x increase from the $53,580 invested, indicating substantial growth. High-value investments (51 rows) average $7,565.69, significantly outperforming low-value ones (49 rows) at $2,731.63. Tech stocks, such as Samsung and Apple, dominate the high-value category, suggesting that their higher volatility and growth potential have contributed significantly to the portfolio's returns. Conversely, fixed income and alternative investment classes, like bonds and art, tend to fall into the low-value category, indicating potential underperformance. It is important to remember that this analysis is a snapshot in time and that market conditions could change. Also, the higher returns of the tech stocks come with an increased risk compared to the lower returning bonds.</p>
